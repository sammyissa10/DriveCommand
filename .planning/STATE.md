# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Logistics owners can manage their entire operation — trucks, drivers, routes, and documents — from one platform, with each route showing the full picture (driver + truck + documents + status) on a single screen.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Multi-Tenant Setup

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation & Multi-Tenant Setup)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-14 — Roadmap created with 10 phases covering all 32 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: - min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Three portals (Admin, Owner, Driver): Multi-tenant SaaS needs platform admin; owners and drivers have distinct needs
- Route as core operational unit: Routes tie together driver + truck + documents — reflects real logistics operations
- Manager-provisioned driver accounts: Prevents unauthorized access to fleet data

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- Phase 1: Tenant isolation is critical — failure here causes data leakage across all subsequent phases
- Phase 6: File upload security must be bulletproof (MIME validation, virus scanning, randomized names)
- Phase 9: Dual-trigger reminder logic (time AND mileage) requires careful implementation to avoid missing alerts
